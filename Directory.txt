How to find a file directory:

• Open File Explorer. 

• Navigate to the folder you want the episode to save to (for example, Downloads). 

• Click once in the address bar at the top — the folder path will highlight (something like C:\Users\YourName\Downloads). 

• Press Ctrl + C to copy it. 

• Now you can paste it into the script prompt with Ctrl + V.
